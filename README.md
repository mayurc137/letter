# letter

Letter takes data, compresses it into a URL fragment, creates a link and shortens it over tinyurl that can be shared. When it is opened, it inflates that data on the receiver’s side.


the letters are contained entirely within their own link.

That means they are...

💼 Portable - you don't need a server to host them

👁 Private - nothing is sent to–or stored on–this server 

🎁 Easy to share as a link are shortened using tiny url
